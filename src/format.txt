An SMV file has three sections, concatenated together:
1) An IMA ADPCM .wav file, with header.
2) An SMV header, described below.
3) A number of .jpeg files, with headers, each prepended by a 24-bit (3-byte)
   little-endian value representing the size, and buffered at the end with
   nulls such that they are at predictable locations (the jpeg modulo).

The SMV header is a magic string in ASCII followed by a number of 24-bit
(3-byte) little-endian values. The following is an example SMV header. Note
that the first entry is the exact ASCII string as it appears in the SMV file,
but the rest are the decimal representation of 24-bit little-endian values.
